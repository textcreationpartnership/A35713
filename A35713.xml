                  <note>Attributed by Wing to Charles Stanley, 8th earl of Derby.</note>
                  <note>"Derby wrote The Jesuits policy to surpress monarchy, proving out of their own writings that the Protestant religion is a sure foundation and principle of a true Christian.  The same work, ... appeared with the author's name, in 1671, bearing the following title:  "The Protestant religion is a sure foundation and principle of a true Christian, and a good subject ..." 'From the second address to the reader, as well as from the title page of another copy, of the same date, both in the Bodleian Library, we learn that the edition of 1671 is the second one.  Of the title or date of the first edition, or whether or not it was anonymous, nothing has been ascertained." -- cf. Halkett and Laing.  This work is possibly, but not certainly, the first edition.</note>
                  <note>Pages 100, 326, 335, 400 and 563 have faded; pages 189, 333, and 574 are tightly bound with some loss of print; pages 397-398 misprinted in filmed copy.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot many years ſince, upon divulging of a Letter, written by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Aldred,</hi> againſt the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and of that ſcandalous Libel againſt the Ambaſſador Count <hi>Gondamour;</hi> as alſo by the inſtigation of ſome Hot-ſpurs in their Pulpits; the people of <hi>London</hi> were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to ſnarl and murmur even at the very name of <hi>Spain;</hi> and every Artificer preſumed, like an <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> to cenſure the King for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48920:3"/> that Negotiation, as for an error of State, which might poſſibly caſt the whole body of the Kingdom into a diſtemper. As if (forſooth) the Kings affection to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his own iſſue, had been unnaturally frozen, or that his judgement had failed him, and thoſe Superior Planets of the Counſel had alſo loſt their light, and erred in their courſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was urged by divers of my good Friends, to write the Apology of that Action and Proceeding; becauſe ſome of them had heard me deliver, at ſundry times, not onely a full Anſwer to all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the contrary faction, but alſo divers Reaſons in defence thereof, founded, as they thought, upon very juſt and ſolid conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And truly, to ſpeak what I think, the benefits which the Realm may reap by this match, are ſuch, and ſo advantageous, as I wiſh it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done, then diſputed on. For firſt, it ſetleth a firm Peace between
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48920:3"/> both the Kingdoms; which is a matter of greater importance, then they ſeem to apprehend, who ſo much oppoſe it. Secondly, Traffick will thereby be eſtabliſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, when the Seas by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both Kings, ſhall be ſcoured of Turks and Pyrats. Thirdly, The Kingdom will be again ſtored with Treaſure and Coyn (provided we keep it lockt up within our Four Seas, and not ſuffer ſo much of it to be offered daily to that Idol of <hi>Cambaia.</hi>) Fourthly, The Crown will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from a burdenſom weight of Debts, and by conſequence, the Subject likely to be much eaſed in matter of Contribution and Taxes. Adde hereunto the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirmation of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Treaties with the Houſe and Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which is not to be reckoned as a Cypher in the buſineſs; and what it is to have ſo great a Monarch, as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> a firm friend and ally, <hi>England</hi> very well knoweth. It is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48920:4"/> true, the Kingdom was never ſo full of Money, as it was by ſpoils and depredations, betwixt the years 1576. and 1590; but how dear thoſe purchaſes might have coſt us, wiſe men ſaw, if God (who had determined to give the Crown of this Nation to her iſſue, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered both diſgrace, and death here for his glory) had not made both Winds and Sea, at that time, to fight for <hi>England.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Virginia</hi> (a Colony of ours tenderly to be regarded) ſhall hereby ſettle her Staples and Mart, and ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nce their Trade by a much ſafer paſſage and entercourſe with the Iſlands: But to me it is above all arguments, That this Match is ſo much for the Honor, Safety, and Commodity of Prince <hi>Charls,</hi> which every true Patriot, I conceive, is bound in conſcience to further and advance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But thus we ſhall be ſaid to leave <hi>Holland</hi> in the bryars, an old and aſſured Friend, and of power upon all occaſions to aſſiſt the Realm. <hi>God grant the Prince never ſtand in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48920:4"/> need of them.</hi> And for our ſelves we may remember, how ſmall further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nay, rather how great hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they have been to the Traffick of this Realm; and what great loſſes and damage our Merchants have ſuſtained by their means, in the <hi>Indies, Muſcovy,</hi> and <hi>Greenland.</hi> I need not tell you, how chargable a Neighbor they have been, nor how unſure a Friend, ever prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>France</hi> before <hi>England;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding the Favors, which they may ſtill receive at his Majeſties hand, are neither few nor ſmall; if themſelves by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate courſes deſerve not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But what cauſe do they pretend, who murmur ſo much againſt <hi>Spain?</hi> They object the Sin, the Curſe, the diſparagement to Match with a Catholike. Have they any reaſon for that? Yes: Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were not permitted to marry with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> nor Religious perſons with the profane. But that is an opinion, which reliſheth too
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48920:5"/> much of Judaiſm, and the Talmud; the Bar is removed, we are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of Grace; both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Circumciſion and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion, in Chriſt are united and made one, and incorporated into one Body, his Church. It is true, the <hi>Jews</hi> might not marry out of their Tribes, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>his Seed;</hi> therefore <hi>his Seed</hi> was not to be ſtained with impure blood, or a commixture of Paganiſm. But now, the promiſe being already perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Judicial Law is abrogated. Yea, ſay they, but ſtill it ſheweth, that God is not well pleaſed, when his children mix with ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people. True: But who are the Superſtitious? and of which ſide is the true Religion? We know that is a queſtion, and will be. But this is out of queſtion, That they are both of them Chriſtians, both are Baptized into that bleſſed Name, both lay hold on the promiſes, on the Teſtaments, on the Goſpel, both pray the ſame <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48920:5"/> both confeſs the ſame <hi>Creed;</hi> yea, both reverence the firſt Four gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councels of the Church. Who indeed is the Catholike, is <hi>Filius Chriſti,</hi> of the ſurer ſide, by reaſon of the Mother Church, and of the elder Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But is it indeed ſo ſtrange a thing, that a Proteſtant ſhould marry a Catholike? not to ſpeak here of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Treaty with Mounſieur (which yet how far and fairly it was proceeded in, by both parties,<note place="margin">Camd. in Elizab.</note> our famous <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſhews at large.) Did not <hi>Henry,</hi> King of <hi>Navar,</hi> a Proteſtant, and the Protector of the Proteſtant Churches in <hi>France,</hi> marry with the <hi>French</hi> Kings Siſter, a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?<note place="margin">Thuanus lib.</note> It was <hi>propter bonum publicum</hi> (as this is) for publike tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace ſake; and therefore did the Elders and Conſiſtory of <hi>Genevah</hi> ſo much as check or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him for it? nay, did they not allow it? The ſame King afterward matcheth his own Siſter, an earneſt Proteſtant, to the Duke
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48920:6"/> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thuanus lib.</note> who is known to be a Prince no leſs earneſtly Catholike, and a Champion of the Catholike, Church in <hi>France.</hi> Nay, did not <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and Protector in chief of the <hi>Huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> party, when time was, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with great deſire the overture of a marriage with <hi>Mary,</hi>

But above all others, it is memorable, and by us <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> not unfit to be conſidered, what a bloody quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel it was made,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Goodwins</hi> Annals, in <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.</note> that King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, who was a Proteſtant King, and the firſt that ever was known in <hi>England,</hi> might not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Papiſt, as all the World knew; yet the Protector made it no ſcruple of Conſcience, to purſue that buſineſs to the utmoſt hazzard. <hi>Calviniſm</hi> and <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> are themſelves as oppoſite as the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> yet they enter-marry frequently, and their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48920:6"/> iſſué bear witneſs thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Was it then tolerable in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and is it now intolerable with <hi>Spain?</hi> Or is there any particular cauſe of ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity and fear in this overture, more then in thoſe other? doth the State of the Kingdom, and fear of alterations, trouble them? that fear is vain. The Husband is head of the Wife, and though the <hi>Infanta</hi> be born <hi>in Familiâ Imperatrice,</hi> yet there is no Soveraignty inveſted in her, ſhe can make no mutation of State, leaſt of all without conſent of the State; and we have little cauſe to diſtruſt her, having had ſuch a preſident before of King <hi>Philip;</hi> who being king of <hi>England,</hi> yet neither did, nor could attempt of himſelf, any alteration. And if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be ſure to hold their Religion, it were neither Juſtice, nor Humanity, if ſhe ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied hers. There is no man of Honor would offend a Lady of her Dignity, for a difference that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns her Soul, her Faith, her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48920:7"/> towards God. What then is the reaſon, why this Match ſeems ſo diſtaſteful? Is the name, are the qualities of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> become ſo odious amongſt us? Surely, <hi>ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itio non fuit ſic,</hi> of old it was not ſo, it is neither an ancient quarrel, nor a natural impreſſion in the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, there was a firm and fixed amity between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and from that <hi>Lancaſter</hi> of <hi>England</hi> the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> are deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As for <hi>Caſtile, John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> married <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Peter,</hi> by right of whom the Crown of <hi>Caſtile</hi> appertained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and his Daughter <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> was married afterward to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> upon which Match, as appears yet in the Records of the <hi>Savoy, John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> reſigning that Crown, the controverſie ended; and the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> as flouriſhing Branches of the Tree and Stock of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> have ever ſince quietly poſſeſſed that Kingdom. So that Prince
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48920:7"/> 
               <hi>Charls</hi> by this Match is likely to warm his Bed again with ſome of his own Blood. I might adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh married his Son to King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Daughter, on purpoſe to continue the Succeſſon of that amity.

Let it ſuffice, that by them all it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, with what mutual, conſtant, and warm affections both Crowns, and both Kingdoms, entertained the ſtricteſt correſpondence that could be; till the Schiſm of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and diſgrace done to Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> by that unhappy Divorce, and the Kings confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>France,</hi> made the firſt breach: So as in thoſe days we ſee, there was no ſuch unkindneſs, no ſuch hatred, no ſuch Antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Nations.

I know very well, how unſearchable the ſecrets of Princes are, in what an abyſs they lie, and how much too deep to be ſounded by every ſhallow diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I remember alſo, what Praying and Preaching here was againſt the Match of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with Mounſieur, a buſineſs of very like nature with this in hand, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt, upon the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended peril of Religion, alteration of Government, and what not? Yet it is very well known, That thoſe of the Councel, who did moſt oppoſe it, were men, which of all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48920:10"/> others, were thought to care leaſt for Religion. Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, (like a Noble and worthy Courtier, as he was) endeavored by a ſhort Treatiſe, to preſent unto Her Majeſty the unfitneſs, diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and inconveniencies of that Match, both in relation to Her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the whole Realm; but he did it privately, and with diſcreet circumſpection. <hi>Stubs,</hi> like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet and fiery Zelot, taking the queſtion in hand, and proſecuting it in a way more likely to incenſe and corrupt the people, then to adviſe or inform the Queen;<note place="margin">Cund. <hi>in</hi> Elizab.</note> his hand paid for his preſumption. And though ſome of the greateſt and wiſeſt of the Councel appeared very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it, as a thing which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to unite the whole Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> unto <hi>England,</hi> and would ſurely bring along with it the offer of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States, whereby <hi>England</hi> was like to become a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Monarchy; yet was the whole Body of the Kingdom caſt into

And if I did not well know the nature of the multitude (which is a Beaſt with many heads, and as mad brains) I ſhould wonder, how they durſt oppoſe the deſigns of their Sovereign, a Prince of ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Judgement, and who hath managed this buſineſs from the beginning with ſuch warineſs, caution, and prudence, as this great Conjunction cannot portend any other effects, then honor, comfort, and proſperity to the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Is he not the fitteſt to judge in his own caſe? And his caſe being the caſe of the Commonwealth in general, if any private man ſhall arrogate to himſelf either more wiſdom to amend what is already

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48920:31"/> oppreſſors; when, I ſay, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people had well drunk in, and were become mad with theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating doctrines of Sedition and Liberty, no long time paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but they riſe in Arms, make Inſurrections, and commit Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and Ryots all the Countries over: Each man was a drum and firebrand to his Neighbor, every one gave alarm to other, to riſe and root out ſo corrupt a Clergy, and depoſe ſuch unworthy Princes.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> But, as it is eaſie to perceive, theſe Doctors Aſſertions do all of them ſuppoſe certain things, which ought firſt to be proved; as for example, 1. That <hi>Caeſar</hi> paſſed the bounds of his Authority; for if he did not,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48920:44"/> it is clear, they paſſed theirs. 2. That he commanded things wicked and unlawful. 3. That he went about to deſtroy true Religion, and their Liberty: All theſe muſt be proved, before it be lawful to take Arms, and reſiſt him, by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. I demand therefore of them this Queſtion, When <hi>Caeſar</hi> or the Supream Magiſtrate commandeth any thing to be done, which is not apparently contrary to the Laws of the Empire then in force, who ſhall be Cenſor, who ſhall Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Caeſar</hi> paſſeth the bounds of his Authority? and whether the things which he commandeth be impious, or no? They anſwer, he abſolutely ſought to deſtroy their Religion and Liberties: But I reply, it hath been an old and uſual ſtratagem of Satan, to oppoſe Religion againſt Religion, thereby to bring in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> and leave us no Religion. Beſide, making <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> to be the onely true Religion, and their Liberties to conſiſt in the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that, they take that for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48920:44"/> granted which <hi>Caeſar</hi> both at <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Auſpurgh</hi> made the greateſt Queſtion. So they argue not well, becauſe they do not proceed <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſis;</hi> yea, it is manifeſt, that when they did preſume to ſet up a new Religion, they paſſed themſelves the bounds of their Authority; and the World might judge <hi>Caeſar</hi> a very ſimple Prince, if he ſhould either change his own Religion, or tolerate theirs upon the bare credit of <hi>Luthers</hi> private opinion and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or upon the bare Proteſtation of the Confederates. For were they competent Judges againſt the whole World? or can Religion be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and orderly changed by Civil Magiſtrates onely? and when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a General Councel, nor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Councel hath decreed it, nor any Imperial Dyet eſtabliſhed it? may every Elector or Prince frame a new Religion for his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince by Law, without conſent of the Emperor and States? Give me an Inſtance, ſhew me a Preſident, when any ſuch Innovation was ever
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48920:45"/> made in the Empire, without an Imperial Dyet. Shew me a Law, or ſome colour of Law, by which it might be done, or elſe confeſs, That the Princes taking up Arms againſt the Emperor was without Juſtice, and their quarrel without lawful ground. Beſide, was it lawful for the Confederates to coyn a new Religion, and maintain it by Arms, and was it not more lawful for the Emperor to defend the old, which was already received, and to reform them? The Boors took Arms upon the ſelf-ſame pretences, <hi>viz.</hi> For Religion and Liberty; yet the Princes with their own forces, and with no leſs Juſtice and Honor, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them. Why might not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Caeſar</hi> compel the Confederates unto the ſame terms, as they did the Boors, <hi>viz.</hi> To exerciſe that Religion which was eſtabliſhed, at leaſt with <hi>à quouſque,</hi> until a legal Reformation could be had, and to obey the Laws in force, and to keep the Peace of the Commonwealth? Doth the degree or dignity of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48920:45"/> perſons make the cauſe ſo different? I trow not. And for any deſigns of <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon them, under colour of Religion, it cannot be made good: They were firſt in the Field; the Emperor had not any forces ready a long time after; yea, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him with their Army, and compelled him to fortifie himſelf:<note place="margin">P. Avila, <hi>de bello</hi> Germanico</note> So that if mens Councels may be gueſſed at by their actings, it is clear, they had rather deſigns upon him: And his favorable dealings with all of them after the Victory, do more then refute ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny. But, ſaith Dr. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is not abſolutely to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the States: It is no matter. He is to be obeyed in ſeeing the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire obſerved, and that is enough to juſtifie his proceedings in the caſe. How far he is abſolute, and how far the Princes do ow fealty and homage to him, and obedience to the Publike Conſtitutions of the Empire, their ſeveral Oaths taken at the Coronation of the one, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48920:46"/> Inveſtitures or Inſtalments of the other, do beſt ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> But I will leave skirmiſhing and come to the main point. It is moſt certain, That <hi>Caeſar</hi> did obſerve the Law, and that the Confederate Princes did violate both the Laws and Liberties of <hi>Germany.</hi> For what Prince ſoever ſtands <hi>Rectus in Curiâ,</hi> having the ancient and known Laws of the Kingdom on his ſide, muſt always be judged to hold a better plea then Subjects, who arm themſelves againſt him il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally, diſorderly, and by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their own private opinions onely. At that time <hi>Caeſar</hi> was bound by Law to extirpate <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſm,</hi> and to maintain the Popes authority in <hi>Germany,</hi> as it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the other parts of Chriſtendom, he was bound to maintain Catholike Religion, and the Immunities or Rights of the Church; ſo manifeſtly, that even their own <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be the Emperors Oath ſo to do; which is not a new Oath
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48920:46"/> neither: For the ſame in effect was taken long ſince by <hi>Carolus</hi> 4. <hi>Otho</hi> 1. and 3. and by <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> which is a preſcription every way good and indiſputable. The like profeſſion alſo we finde made by thoſe ancient and religious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, <hi>Theodoſius, Gratian, Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Juſtinian,</hi> and others, both in the <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Novel Conſtitutions.</hi> How therefore could the Emperor, either maintain or ſuffer any other Religion in the Empire, then that which he found already eſtabliſhed, and allowed by all his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, declared by ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, continued ſo many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ratified by all the Imperial Dyets, and laſtly, by his own Oath? Beſide, did the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> or the <hi>Landſgrave,</hi> when they were priſoners, ever plead the Law on their ſide? did they ever uſe any ſuch argument, any ſuch excuſe? No; they ſubmitted abſolutely, and craved pardon for their lives, from his hands to whom they were forfeited; and how ridiculous alſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48920:47"/> had the plea been? For ſhall the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> take arms for the defence of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> and may not the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Rhine</hi> do the ſame in defence of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> which yet the <hi>Lu herans</hi> will not endure? or an <hi>Halberſtat</hi> for <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſm?</hi> or a <hi>Muncer</hi> with his Boors for <hi>Anabaptiſm?</hi> and ſo by <hi>Anarchy,</hi> under pretence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Liberties, rend in peices the Empire, and open the Ports of <hi>Germany</hi> to the <hi>Turk.</hi> But to ſtop the mouth of Learned Ignorance, I will diſcover more particularly, and lay down the foundation of this great quarrel betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the Confederate Princes, and the legal order and method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, which the Emperor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerved therein.</p>

At <hi>Auſpurgh</hi> again in the year 1530. the Emperor moſt graciouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Duke, and received a Petition from him, with as much favor and indifferency as could ſtand with his honor: And there again revived his Ambaſſadors mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Spires,</hi> that no further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations might be made, no more Books publiſhed, but that at leaſt all things might abide in quiet State, till the Seventeenth of <hi>May</hi> enſuing: So much did his Imperial Majeſty yeeld for Peace ſake.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48920:50"/> yet the Duke rejected his motion; which ſo much diſpleaſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, that he forbore not to tell him, and the reſt of the Leaguers, <hi>That if they obeyed not, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it.</hi> And yet again, at <hi>Spires</hi> he labored to have prevailed with them by fair means; but thither the Duke (being grown more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and fearful of <hi>Caeſar</hi>) would not come. However by this courſe, which the Emperor conſtantly held towards them, you may ſee, how unwilling he was to diſturb the Peace, or to begin the War; and how inexcuſable they were, that rejected ſo often the offers of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.</p>

And therefore though he teach not the one, yet he may teach the other. Extenuate the words, as much as you can, yet they will be really heinous and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For he that holdeth a King is not worthy <hi>to be, or to live among

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:48920:90"/> and by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, in the year 1556. All men were forbidden to bear Arms, or to hold any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intelligences, Councels, or Aſſemblies for Conference, but in Town houſes, or publike places. By <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, at <hi>Bloys,</hi> in the year 1579. prohibition was made againſt the aſſembling or gathering of any Troops, upon occaſion or pretence of private quarrels; or to enter into any ſuch kinde of Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.

They accuſed the Queen of procuring the death of her Husband, the Lord <hi>Henry Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> out of a deſire and intention to marry <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal in the murther.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48920:99"/> til ſhe cleer her ſelf from the imputation of ſuch heinous crimes. Theſe were their Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pretenſes. But touching the Murther it was very unlike to be true; and certainly required manifeſt proofs, if ever any cauſe did. Her Sex was not fit for ſuch a Butchery; and her nature known to be too Royal, to harbor ſuch diſhonorable Treachery: though ſhe had ſome juſt cauſe of offence againſt him. If ſhe had deſired to put him to death, he was her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſhe might have done it, openly, legally, and by courſe of Juſtice.

Firſt they object, that <hi>Douglas,</hi> Earl <hi>Bothwels</hi> man, was executed for it. True. And that it was he, that brought a Box of Letters of the Queens to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> which he had received of Sir <hi>James Balfoor</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to carry to his Maſter; by which Letters intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their juglings and practiſes (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Queen and <hi>Bothwel</hi>) were diſcovered. It is anſwered, Lyes have commonly one Leg ſhort; and ſo 'tis here. For is it probable, that either the Queen, or the Earl ſhould repoſe ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſo great ſecrets in a man, that was known to be at the devotion of a contrary Faction, as Sir <hi>James Balfoor</hi> was? Is it likely
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48920:100"/> ſhe would at all ſend ſuch a Packet, which ſhe knew contained matter of great Peril, but of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence at all to her ſelf? For ſhe directs them to be burnt, and might have done that her ſelf well enough without the labor of ſending them to him. Beſide, the Queen ever denied thoſe Letters to be hers, though her hand had been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited to them; neither was there Superſcription, Indorſement, Seal, Date, or any thing elſe, that might poſſibly diſcover more cleerly, whoſe they were, or from whom coming. Her hand was onely Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the Letters themſelves of another Character; and truly it is not probable, that in a buſineſs of ſo great privacy, ſhe ſhould require the State of a Secretary, and that of ſome Stranger too? for had it been the hand of any of her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Amanuenſes,</hi> the caſe had been cleer, and a diſcovery would have been eaſily made. Neither could he, who delivered them, ever be found out to diſcover the Pack;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48920:100"/> and <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> who was the man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to carry them, proteſted at his death, that he never knew of any ſuch Letters. Laſtly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that ſhe had indeed ſent them, yet was there no expreſs proof of any unlawful act, attempt, or practiſe to charge her with. Suppoſe ſhe had deſired to have her husband murthered: doubtleſs it had been a great offence againſt God, and odious to all men; but was it a ſufficient cauſe for her own Subjects to take Arms againſt her, and to depoſe her?

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> and <hi>Bathſhebah?</hi> Yet he forfeited not his Crown.

Many, She mourned faintly for his death, which is a ſign, ſhe was weary of his life. She acquitted <hi>Bothwel</hi> for his death, and did not puniſh him, as he deſerved, <hi>Ergo,</hi> let her die. But what a <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipoliloquides</hi> is this <hi>Buchanan?</hi> are ſuch conjectural preſumptions, as theſe, matter of evidence ſufficient to depoſe Princes? As for her Mourning and the Funerals, His Body was Embalmed, and laid by <hi>James</hi> the fifth her Father; the Lord <hi>Tracquaire,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Clerk</hi> and others attended the Corps; indeed moſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48920:101"/> of the Counſel being Proteſtants, the Catholike Ceremonies were not permitted: and in <hi>Scotland</hi> it is not the cuſtom to reſerve the Corps Fourty days. Nor was it decent, that the Queen her ſelf ſhould have been there perſonally mourning, as a Subject: therefore ſhe mourned privatly, as his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and Wife; which ſhe did ſo long, that her Counſel, and Phyſitians both were forced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her from it, and to ceaſe. All which Sir <hi>Henry Killegrew</hi> might witneſs, who was ſent from <hi>England</hi> to condole and comfort her. What could be required more of a Wife?</p>
               <p>

For Firſt, was not <hi>Bothwel</hi> acquitted for this crime by his Peers? was not <hi>Murray</hi> himſelf, (who beſt knew the Plot) together with the Lord <hi>Lindſey, Sempil,</hi> and other adherents, principal to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48920:102"/> his purgation? The Queen did not acquit him out of her own affection, or will onely, but by their advice and Counſel, who were the chief <hi>Pilots</hi> of the State, at that time. Nay, did not the ſame parties <hi>Murray, Sempil,</hi> &amp;c. procure others of the Nobles to joyn with them, and ſollicited the Queen to Marry <hi>Bothwel,</hi> pretending it neceſſary for her to take ſuch a Husband, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her in troubleſome times; yea did they not in ſome maner force her to it? and by their Hand-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> did they not binde themſelves to obey him, in caſe he would marry her? did not they themſelves, <hi>viz. Murray, Sempil</hi> and the reſt, (in order to this) procure the Divorce of <hi>Bothwel</hi> from his firſt Wife, ſiſter to the Earl of <hi>Huntly?</hi> and are thereby moſt cleerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of double dealing? But what follows? The charg of the Murther. And of this <hi>the Lord</hi> Harris <hi>accuſed</hi> Murray <hi>himſelf, viz.</hi> that at <hi>Craig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millar,</hi> he, <hi>Morton,</hi> and <hi>Bothwel</hi> did conſult, conſpire, and determine the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48920:102"/> Kings death; for the effecting whereof Indentures were there drawn and ſubſcribed by them. And to convince it more evidently, <hi>Pourry, Paris,</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> who were all three Executed for the Murther, confeſſed at their death, and called God to witneſs, that thoſe two (<hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi>) were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal contrivers of it. The like did <hi>John Hepburn, Bothwels</hi> ſervant, at his Execution for the ſame Fact; proteſting that he had ſeen the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Writings drawn to that purpoſe, as we ſaid. To blinde the world therefore a little, <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> take up Arms upon a pretence to apprehend <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and ſend out ſhips to purſue him at Sea, whom themſelves had ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; yea had ſent the Lord <hi>Grange</hi> on purpoſe to him, to adviſe and will him for his own ſafety, to be gone, promiſing, that no body ſhould purſue him: as indeed none did very haſtily: for he ſtayed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this no leſs then two Months in <hi>Scotland, viz.</hi> until <hi>Murray</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48920:103"/> out of <hi>France.</hi> Then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he muſt be gone; otherwiſe by his ſtay, or their taking him, they would be all betrayed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So he finding himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach't by his Aſſociates in the Conſpiracy, and being as ſure to be overpowered by them, if he ſhould abide it, was content at laſt to withdraw, and be offered up as a Sacrifice to the cenſure of the world for their purgation.

It proceeded without all doubt from the Spirit and humor of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who firſt deviſed it; and was himſelf a bitter enemy againſt all Magiſtrates, in whoſe Counſels he could not rule: In ſo much, as at <hi>Genevah</hi> it ſelf, he was at firſt expelled <hi>for a ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon</hi> by the Magiſtrates of that City; and compelled to go live with <hi>Bucer</hi> at <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the party, which favored him, prevailing at <hi>Genevah,</hi> he

So it was promiſed by a general conſent of the City, and at his coming performed; His conſiſtory, that is to ſay, an Oligarchy of certain pickd Elders, was erected, as it were the Inquiſition of <hi>Genevah.</hi> This, by the way, was a ſtrain of policy much beyond <hi>Luthers</hi> dull reach, and which madded him all his life long. For by this <hi>Calvin</hi> did not onely ſet up a Church Independent of him, and without conſulting at all with him, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Luther,</hi> but became a Dictator general, as it were, to all the Proteſtant or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches abroad; and ſo very much Eclipſed <hi>Luthers</hi> glory.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48920:111"/> of Biſhops and other Prelates of the Church were, not onely wont to finde, but apt to procure eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſpect with the people. Now ask a Puritan his opinion of a Rochet, a Surplis, cornerd Cap, or any other Habit, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth Eccleſiaſtical perſons from the Laity, he tells you preſently, They are the raggs of Antichriſt, badges of Superſtition; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Book he calls the Porteſs and Breviary of Satan; ſet prayers extinguiſh zeal with him, yea are <hi>tantum non</hi> flat Idolatry; The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts are the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues or Shops of the Devil, and but the excrements of a corrupted diſcipline, which they would fain reform.

                  </gap> hereſie, which by this time was, like a Gangreen, ſpread over the greateſt part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and not the leaſt in theſe <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> where under the ſhadow of religion eſpecially of abetting and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>liberty of Conſcience,</hi> as they called it, All factions of State and diſcontentments of Ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhrowded themſelves. The peoples natural inclination to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty was great, and ſet it much
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48920:118"/> forward; yet there wanted not the Concurrence of ſome Forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (to blow the Coals of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) both out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France. Charls</hi> the Fifth, Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, a wiſe and provident Prince, remembringing what a piece of work <hi>Luther</hi> had lately cut him out in Germany, and with what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, difficulty, and charge he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it, intended, as well for the quietneſs of theſe Provinces, as for his own Intereſt and Honor, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as much as he could, the Propagation of <hi>Martineſts</hi> and all other Sects whatſoever. And to that end, finding no other means more proper, and fit to be applied unto ſuch a <hi>Malady,</hi> had eſtabliſhed the Inquiſition among them, about the yeer 1550. for the Execution whereof <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> then Regent of the Low-Countries procured ſuch Explication and Mitigation of ſome Circumſtances, as was judged neceſſary. But after this, the Emperor reſigning the whole government of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces

                  </gap>crated the laſt act of his life entirely to God and devotion. King <hi>Philip</hi> at the firſt entrance into his government, finding how much the Sects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily in <hi>Flanders,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the means oppoſed againſt them, and conſidering what danger would enſue upon it to the State, followed ſtrictly his Fathers adviſe, and in the year 1555. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the Commiſſion, Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Articles for the ſaid Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But this, as it happened through the general contagion and diſtemper of mindes, which Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie had bred in the people, provd onely matter of further diſcontent to the Inhabitants of the Nether-Lands, and did no good. They alledge, that all Strangers would thereupon be forced to depart the Country, and by conſequence their Trading would decay, which was the Golden Mine and maintenance
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48920:119"/> of thoſe Provinces. Thus they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; but indeed their inward grief was the humor of Innovation, to which they were much inclined, and therefore feared themſelves. There was another Politick Act of the Kings, yet withall of very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious concernment and deſign, which added Fewel to this Fire, namely, the Erecting of thoſe new Biſhopricks at <hi>Gaunt, Ipres,</hi>

                  <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp, &amp;c.</hi> which he intended all the Provinces over. And a third, <hi>viz.</hi> the authority and power of the Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> whoſe Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Hat lately procured him by the Kings favor, made him the more odious; ſo as the greater his Obligation was to his Holineſs, or the King their Sovereign, ſo much more, it ſeemed, was the malice both of the Nobility and common people incenſed againſt him. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they urge their Ancient privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and liberties which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, were violated by the King; They would have no Strangers rule or bear Office among them;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48920:120"/> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> muſt be diſmiſſed the Country; and ſome new liberties granted, <hi>viz.</hi> Liberty of Conſcience, and Toleration for Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".3"/> Thus were the names of <hi>Liberty and Religion</hi> made the Standard-bearers, as it were, to their future Commotions. But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their ſeveral grievances. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt, that of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the name is of greater Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror then the thing: It was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed upon a nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſity againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> and upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the uſe and benefit thereof, continued. And though I ſhall not commend any ſign, or proceedings, that ſavor of cruelty, yet I cannot condemn this: becauſe it addeth nothing to the puniſhment of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which the Law did not inflict before; but requires onely a more ſtrict Execution of the Law, and a more diligent courſe of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be uſed by the Inquiſitors. And certainly, under God, it hath been the chief Antidote, which hath preſerved <hi>Spain</hi> ſo well and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48920:120"/> ſo long free from the infection of hereſies, and from ſuch dangerous and laſting tumults as do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow them, and wherewith the other Kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> have been generally embroyled. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, when they were moſt diſcontented, never complained of it; nor is it in it ſelf a more bloody Law or Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice, then the Conſiſtory it ſelf at <hi>Genevah</hi> doth maintain, and hath executed more then once, though unjuſtly and Tyrannically, conſidering what principles they pretend, and what outcries and obteſtations they once made for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience, Liberty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, Liberty of the Spirit,</hi> which is their onely <hi>Judge of Controverſies,</hi> according to the <hi>written word alone,</hi> and not any Conſiſtory, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men whatſoever. Beſides, as it was at firſt propounded by the King, out of his zeal for the good and quiet of the Country, ſo was it by his wiſdom ſuſpended afterwards, finding, they were not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48920:121"/> capable of ſuch a remedy. For the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the Erecting of the new Biſhopricks it was a prudent and neceſſary reſolution to bridle Sectaries, and as a Sythe, to cut down thoſe Weeds, which grew ſo faſt in Gods Church. For by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing in each Province grave and learned men, to ſtand as Watchmen and Sentinels againſt the Enemies of the Church and State, it would be more eaſie, by concurrence of their Authority, and by their vigilancy over their Flocks, to preſerve the people from danger of ſeducement. Neither was it a new deſign. For <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had long before deſired it, as a thing very needful; becauſe in his time all the Seventeen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces (except onely the Dioceſs of <hi>Arras</hi> were under ſuch Biſhops, as were ſtrangers to the Country, and Subjects of Forreign Princes; which could not be convenient for the State. And what good their Erection hath wrought, experience daily ſheweth, in thoſe places where
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48920:121"/> they ſtill continue. For now every Dioceſs is carefully viſited by a Biſhop of the ſame Country and Language; who as he hath more natural compaſſion, ſo hath he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more knowledge and care to inſtruct his Countrymen in the way that is right, and to weed out diſorders. And therefore was the Erection allowed, and ratified by <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius Quartus</hi> in the year 1559. Concerning the third, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Arras,</hi> Although his wiſdom and experience in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of government, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical as Civil, was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to the King, yet becauſe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with the Counts <hi>Egmond</hi> and <hi>Horn,</hi> did joyntly write to the King againſt him, His Majeſtie, though to his great diſſervice, was content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him, for their ſatisfaction. But when this was done, neither was the Country any whit the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter, for his calling away; nor did they themſelves ceaſe from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practiſing.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48920:122"/> and franchiſes, had not the King confirm'd them all at the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful entry?

And yet for addition, and their further aſſurance of the Kings good affection to them and the Provinces, he left his Siſter the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> Governor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with them, a Woman of a

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In this maner were all things wiſely and moderately conſtituted by the King, and might have ſo continued, had the Nobles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with their duty, and not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored ſo much thoſe ſpirits of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and Tumult, which lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down the Country, and had infected no ſmall part of the Common people. Howbeit all things remained outwardly quiet for a long while; The fire that was, lay covered in Aſhes: The firſt breaking out was not, til Baron <hi>Brederode</hi> and his Aſſociates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their Petition to the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs; which containing many things neither fit for them to aske, nor ſafe for her to grant, was, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, look't upon as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to ſome future Troubles. Henceforward the Heads of the Faction plot the advancing of their

Was it not time for the King to Arm, when the people were in Arms, and had, beſide their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

When the Cities were all in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars, and the whole frame of the Common-wealth ſeeming to be ſhaken? Had not the King all the reaſon in the World to ſend <hi>D' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> and forces of his own, when the Provincial Governors would not be commanded to apply theirs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to the buſineſs? It was certainly high time to do that which he did, not onely to repreſs and keep in order thoſe rebellious Spirits, which were diſperſed and acting in all parts of the Country; but alſo to encounter and oppoſe <hi>Orange,</hi> who by this time, what by his open backwardneſs and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to ſuch Counſels as tended to a ſpeedy redreſs of thoſe evils, and what by his ſecret practiſes and abetting of the Delinquent party, had no leſs undermined the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48920:126"/> it ſelf, then he had diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and wearied the Governeſs.

Was it lawful for them to ſurprize <hi>Montz,</hi> and was it not more lawful for the King to expel them? Let no man dream, that if the Dukes forces had not come, the Country would have been quiet: for that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to any body, that knew the State of affairs. The fire was not quenched, but covered, and would have broken out again in a greater flame. The Confederating of ſo many and great Perſons, countenanced by the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors themſelves, did Prognoſticate a ſtorm to be yet coming; and all

The firſt viſible diſguſt he took, was upon the Kings going into <hi>Spain.</hi> The Prince being then a Widower, aſpired to marry with the Princeſs <hi>Chriſterna,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Couſin Germane to the King, and labored alſo, that ſhe might be made Governeſs of the Provinces in the Kings abſence; to the intent, that by ſuch Alliance
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48920:130"/> he might in effect ſway the whole Government of the Provinces him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: a thing indeed for which he had gaped a long time, and ſtood competitor with Count <hi>Egmond.</hi> But the King preferring the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Parma,</hi> he loſt both his hopes and his Wife. Upon this grew his firſt hatred againſt <hi>D' Alva</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>Granvellan,</hi> by whoſe Counſels, he ſuppoſed, the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Parma</hi> was preferred. So as Ambition and Pride being indeed the true internal motives of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, Religion, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths intereſt, muſt be made the Mantle to hide it. Hereupon he marrieth into the houſe of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> which was already <hi>Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized,</hi> and ſets <hi>Brederode</hi> and his fellows to work, as we have ſeen already.

In a word I may wel conclude, he was the great Wheel, whereupon the whole State of the Confederates affairs turned.

What if that which the King at his Inauguration promiſed for the good of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, cannot be obſerved now, but with the great dammage of the Province, and of all <hi>Europe?</hi> and this occaſioned by the diſtemper and change of the people themſelves of the Province? of neceſſity, if the <hi>caſe,</hi> that is to ſay, the condition and ſtate of affairs be ſo far chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reſolutions and proceedings upon them muſt alſo change.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In the year 1608. this great U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion did begin; The Cheifs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine, Chriſtian</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Onoltzbach,</hi> Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> was a principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and in the year 1619. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto, and in contempt of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Proclamations, Letters, &amp;c. ſent Two thouſand men to the Aid of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Afterward they admitted <hi>Joachim,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> to be as it were Vicar or Lieutenant
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48920:162"/> General of the League. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted alſo the Marquis of <hi>Baden,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wittembergh, Landſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> Duke of <hi>Dupontz,</hi> and <hi>Strasburgh, Norimbergh</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Cities. All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed ſo largly to theſe Wars, as the Emperor never received the like Aid from them againſt the <hi>Turke.</hi> For as <hi>Cogmandolo</hi> teſtifieth, The ſeveral Taxes afforded by them from the year 1608 to the year 1619 amounted in the whole ſum to no leſs then Four Millions, one hundred ſeventy ſix thouſand, nine hundrd and ſeventeen Florens. The concurrence of ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could not but argue mighty force; which was much increaſed by the Negotiations of <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> and <hi>Nomarus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> (which <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> was <hi>Baltazar Newwen</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Secretary to <hi>Onoltzbach.</hi>) and of <hi>Volrad Pleſſen</hi> with the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and of others with the Duke of <hi>Bullion, Bethlehem Gabor,</hi> and the Rebels of <hi>Hungary.</hi> And though they could not perſwade the King

The pretenſe of their Union was, that it was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defenſive, for the protection on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their Religion, Liberties and Priviledges. <hi>Vetus Cantilena,</hi> the old ſong, I confeſs, but who can beleeve them? Can it be ſuppoſed of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> that he took Arms one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Conſcience, having been ſo well beaten in <hi>France</hi> for it, both out of his Honor and Fortunes? or that Count <hi>Mansfeld</hi> is a man that fights onely for Conſcience,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48920:163"/> and Publike liberty, whoſe Trade and patrimony is the Sword, and who, braving the World moſt commonly with a running Army, more uſed to Pillage then Fight, Robs and Spoils all, where ever he comes?

And in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf, which contains One and twenty Articles in all, although they ſay, it was onely their <hi>Buckler</hi> againſt the Catholikes <hi>aſſaulting</hi> them, yet do they not profeſs, <hi>Art.</hi> 8. to have intention to expel <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſm,</hi> as they call it? and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves from the Yoak of <hi>Spain</hi> and forreign Government?

Such were the vaſt, but vain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of their Ambition and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice. But before we proceed any further, it may not be amiſs to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48920:166"/> examine their Plea. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, their deſign in it ſelf was moſt pernicious, and ſuch, as (if it had taken effect, which God would not ſuffer) had been of general prejudice to the State of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not onely to the Peace of the Empire; which yet every one of the Princes Confederate were bound, in ſome relation or other, to maintain: beſide the ſubverſion of all Laws, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently it carryed along with it. Who doth not remember, how all the Pulpits in <hi>England,</hi> when time was, and generally of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad, ſounded the Alarme againſt the League and Leaguers in <hi>France?</hi> Which yet was not half ſo miſcheivous as this; but was at firſt ſet on foot quietly, without any ſedition or inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, onely for defenſe of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Religion, always received and eſtabliſhed in <hi>France:</hi> yea confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the Kings perſonal Oath and approbation. And though it were afterward continueed, and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48920:166"/> more ſtrictly proſecuted, upon occaſion of ſome horrid Actions of murther and tyranny, yet Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Villeroy</hi> himſelf, (who was a wiſe man, and a great Royalliſt,) profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,) that their aim was not the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> but his <hi>Reformation;</hi> and that if they might <hi>be aſſured of his Religion</hi> (which he had promiſed) he <hi>ſhould be inſtantly aſſured of their obedience:</hi> as in the concluſion it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; every perſon in <hi>France,</hi> according as the King condiſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give them ſatisfaction in that point, entirely acknowledging their Allegiance to him. And the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap which befel him afterwards, was not in purſuance of the League, but upon a private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not to ſay, upon ſome new provocation given, and which no man living juſtified. But as for this Union, it runs in a far wilder ſtrain, and is for the advancement of a <hi>new Religion,</hi> entirely diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed by all the States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in all their publike Acts. How
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48920:167"/> then can it be otherwiſe then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſloyal and criminous? The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> himſelf, though a Proteſtant Prince, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it, and adviſed the <hi>Palatine</hi> very prudently, and like a friend, to quit <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and to ſeek for reconciliation and pardon, where as yet, he might poſſibly finde it. Beſide it opened the Gates of the Empire to the <hi>Turk,</hi> which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief alone, had there been no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going along with it, had been ſufficient to condemn it. But <hi>Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> confeſſeth in his Letter to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halt,</hi> That <hi>it was an Action of the ſame nature with</hi> Holland: and what that was, we have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. In brief they took arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a King Lawfully Elected, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Crowned, and eſtabliſhed in poſſeſſion by conſent of the States. It is true, when they firſt went about the work, they nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor with the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> for <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia;</hi> but that was meerly craft, and a trick of maliciouſneſs, to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48920:167"/> render the Duke ſuſpected with the Emperor. They knew he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their offer and Confederacy long before, when their Agent the Count <hi>Slick</hi> ſollicited him in their names. By this means they put <hi>Auſtria</hi> it ſelf, the Emperors Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Country, into ſedition; The people there, through corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> were ſo bold as to tell <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> that unleſs he would grant them <hi>Toleration, and ſuch Liberty of Conſcience, as they deſired,</hi> they would joyn with his Enemies. And they were in this point as good as their words; For in the year 1620. all the upper <hi>Auſtria</hi> did really quit their old Lord; and ſubmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new Protector in his ſtead. If the Catholikes of England ſhould attempt the like, how would it be cenſured for ſedition, and puniſhed ſeverely, as it might? and yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſes are much Parallel, and if there be any advantage, it is on our ſide; who deſire the exerciſe of nothing, but what was once pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,

But for all this, the Zealots of her time would not be quieted, nor ſuffer her to enjoy any quiet; They Libel againſt the Government of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; they pick quarrels and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at her marriage; they publiſh invectives and ſcurrilous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets againſt Religion; yea, they forbear not to conſpire and plot Her Deprivation, out of a deſire to advance Her Succeſſor to the Crown, under whom every <hi>Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt</hi> expected a Golden Age.

But the Queſtion, which King <hi>Henry</hi> (the firſt of all Kings, Princes or States of Chriſtendom) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to his Clergy and People in Parliament, concerned matters purely Spiritual, and wherein, not himſelf onely and his Subjects at home, but all Chriſtian Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, States, and people in the world, were concerned. And therefore required far greater deliberation, I ſay not, then was uſed, (for in truth that was little or none at all; the Kings pleaſure and reſolution was known, and that, as the world went then, was ſufficient:) but, I ſay, then could poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48920:195"/> Captivity, and ſtood meerly (as they have done ever ſince) at the pleaſure of the King, and of the State. Their Poſſeſſions (the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them) were ſeized, their Goods forfeited, their Churches profaned and ſacked, and upon the ſpoils thereof, together with the ſale of the Veſtments, Chalices, Bells, and other the Moveables and Ornaments belonging to them, the <hi>Augmentation Court</hi> was erected. For the King ſeeing this extraordinary paſſiveneſs and ſubmiſſion of the Clergy, could never think he had power ſufficient, till he had more then enough; and therefore having already diſcharged his conſcience from all Bonds, but ſuch onely as himſelf ſhould think good to tie, he took liberty to commit ſuch outrages and violence upon Sacred things, as no age before him, nor ſince can parallel. For firſt, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 27. of His Reign he appoints the Secretary <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Leigh</hi> (as his Commiſſioners) to viſit the Abbyes; and they, by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48920:196"/> vertue of their ſaid Commiſſion, firſt take out all the Plate, cheifeſt Jewels and Reliques belonging to thoſe houſes, and ſeize them to the Kings uſe: Then they diſmiſs all ſuch perſons Religious, as were under the age of Four and twenty years, and had a deſire to be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the world, <hi>Anno</hi> 28.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48920:196"/> outed, and left unprovided even of Habitation; above Ten thouſand perſons, for no particular crimes charged or proved againſt them, turned out of their own doors, and driven to ſeek their fortune, where they could. A thing which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionated the very common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves, (though not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle alienated in their affections at that time, towards Monaſticks, more then they were wont to be;) to ſee ſo many perſons compelled to Beg and live by Almes, who by their bountiful and conſtant Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality had formerly releived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>

For indeed they were forced in ſome ſort to proceed thus politickly in their work of deſolation, and to carry it on by degrees, by reaſon of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty;
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48920:197"/> who, though they ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, yet they ſtood amazed, as it were, murmuring as lowd as they durſt, and were not a little unſatisfied at ſuch doings. But in the years 32. and 33. generally all the Monaſteries of <hi>England,</hi> of what value ſoever, went to wrack, and were deſtroyed; The Lands belonging to Saint <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> were likewiſe given to the King, and the Corporation of thoſe Knights quite diſſolved: Though to turn out theſe with ſome kinde of contentment, there was, as ſome ſay, certain Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons during life diſtributed among them, to the value of Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eight hundred and ſeventy pounds. In <hi>Anno</hi> 37. was the laſt ſweep, which King <hi>Harry</hi> made. For then all the Chauntries in any part of the Kingdom (which were many and numerous,) All Churches and places Collegiate, yea the very Hoſpitals (which were built and endowed by their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Founders, onely, and expreſly
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48920:197"/> for the relief of the poor,) were yet given to the King, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wholly to his order and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. The value of Church Lands in <hi>England</hi> at this time amounted to above Three hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand one hundred and eighty pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> and of it the King took into his own poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and apropriated to the Crown to the value of One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty one thouſand one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds yearly rent: The reſt, it ſeems, was ſold, or exchanged, or diſtributed among Favourites. Laſtly, to abuſe the poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons perfectly, and more eaſily to wipe them of thoſe great and conſtant advantages, as well Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral as Spiritual, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from theſe Religious places while they ſtood, a propoſition is made in Parliament by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors and Sharers in this worke, and 'tis given out alſo to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abroad, That out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of theſe Lands thus given to the King, a ſtanding Army, for

This indeed was as pleaſing a bait for the people, as could be deviſed, and it took accordingly: They bit willingly at it; But the Hook ſticks in their jaws to this day. Such a motion as this (to note in a word by the way) was made in that Parliament of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth which they called <hi>the Lay-mens Parliament,</hi> by thoſe which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced <hi>Wicleff,</hi> and loved the Lands, far better then they did the Religion of the Church: But their deſigns at that time were defeated by the Stout and Religious oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48920:198"/> joyning with him.

The Lords and Courtiers
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48920:199"/> could not diſlike the motion, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a rich Prey would fall to be divided among them. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this pleaſed the principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State (afterward Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Seal, Lord High Chamberlain of <hi>England,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) who being a man of great experience, and of a deep reach in worldly policies, knew full well, that ſuch a confuſed Innovation as this, and ſo full of Spoyle, would be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantagious to him, and a Ladder, to clime at eaſe unto what Wealth or Honor he could wiſh. He therefore inſtigates the King with all might and main to go through with the Action, and to ſtand ſtoutly to his Prerogative and profit, knowing his conſcience was already buried in <hi>Anne Bolens</hi> Tombe. To this end, and the better to pave the way to his evil deſigns, (Sacriledge and Blood not ſeldom going along together,) Three of the principal Abbots of the Kingdom, and Barons of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> the Abbots of <hi>Glaſtenbury,

I cannot tell, what it may do now, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to have mov'd ſuch a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, it would have coſt a man his head. It is certain, theſe Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies held their Lands in <hi>Frank Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moigne,</hi> and in Fee, They were qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly poſſeſſed of them by the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Guifts of many <hi>Saxon, Engliſh, Norman</hi> Kings, Princes and other Subjects, who were their Founders; continued legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by preſcription in them; admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, acknowledged and eſtabliſhed by all Laws; beſide the acceſſory

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48920:200"/> and diſlike of any crime more then by requiring or order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a puniſhment for it. The Second, That as by one and the ſame Charter, both the Church and the Temporalty held their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; ſo that which gave, or pretended to give, the King power to abrogate and deſtroy the one, could not, in point of reaſon or juſtice, but make the other obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

For after his Divorce from his firſt and lawful Queen <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> no wife could pleaſe him long; few of them could get protection
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48920:204"/> for their heads, and none of them all live long either ſecure or joyful. Beſide, did his Exchequer thrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better for the Augmentations? Was his Treaſury any whit better furniſht, then his Predeceſſors before him, Catholike Princes, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorers of the Church? Nay, was there ever King of <hi>England</hi> more neceſſitated then he was in point of Treaſure, and that immediatly as it were, and in very few years after thoſe great ſpoils? Did ever King of <hi>England</hi> before him lye more heavy upon his ſubjects in matter of Taxes, Subſidies, Loanes, then he did after that? Did ever any of them uſe more ignoble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>princely wayes to raiſe money then he? Our own Chronicles, and the much baſe money which he coined, doe ſufficiently ſhew how things went with him in that regard. But that which may ſeem moſt of all to be noted, as an argument of Gods diſpleaſure againſt him, was the fruſtrating of that, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be his chief project and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48920:204"/> deſign in all thoſe frequent marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and unmarryings, <hi>viz.</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Iſſue. All his hopefull Stem and Branches have been taken away one after another without Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; and ſome of them but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily too: And his Crown and Scepter tranſlated, much contrary to his intentions, unto another Name and Nation, God ſuffering him, as a blinde man, to erre in his ends, and wander in all his courſes. Yea all that great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which he raked together upon the ruins of the Church; how was it employed? How ſpent, but in the exceſs of vanity and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? Neither to any honour of the Realm, nor to the eaſe of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor to the maintenance of ſouldiers, nor to the relief of the poor, (all which were pretended mainly when the buſineſs was to be done) but in Tiltings, Triumphs, Mummeries, Maſquings, in pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enriching his Miſtreſſes, and to ſatisfie the greedy appetites and expectations of thoſe ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48920:205"/> of his Luſts. In a word, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and Prodigality conſumed all.

And for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he had wearied his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with a long, chargeable, and ingloricus Reign, and that he found his ſoul, as much oppreſſed with the guilt of innumerable hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſins, as his body was become unweildy and troubleſome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, through his exceſſive intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, he died, as ſome good Authors ſay,<note place="margin">Thuan.</note> deſirous to repent, and to be reconciled to the Church; but what effect his deſires had, (which we wiſh might be to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his ſoul) is only known to God.</p>

Yet of the two the calamity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector muſt, in all humane judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeem moſt diſaſtrous. For 'tis certain, through his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the importune inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Wife, he was compelled to ſerve the deſigns of his greateſt Adverſary in the world, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own brother to death.

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48920:216"/> thoſe, whoſe ſins well deſerved ſuch puniſhment, they were (both of them taken away by the hand of Juſtice, and met with their deſerts Temporally; and things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to ſome better paſs. But what did the Catholikes all this while? How did they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? What Rebellions did they raiſe? what commotions or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of the people did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure? I mean the more civil, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ingenuous amongſt them. 'Tis true, ſome Riſings there were in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and the Weſtern parts, of the rude multitude, exaſperated eſpecially upon ſome temporal grievances, oppreſſions, and wants, which followed the miſgovernment of thoſe times; Religion was either not at all, or leaſt of all pretended by them: They were vexed indeed to ſee the encroachments, which the Protector and others made dayly upon the Kings and Peoples Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; They were ſenſible of the Scarcity and Dearth of all kinde of neceſſary commodities for life,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48920:216"/> which came ſuddenly upon them, and was far greater then it uſed to be; They could not endure well to be abridged, by Incloſures, of ſome other Liberties which they pretended to; In brief, They were ſenſible of all ſuch inconveniences in the Government of the State, as concerned <hi>the Outward Man;</hi> but for Religion, further then it ſerved to eaſe their Spleen, that is, to cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, to aſperſe and rail upon thoſe, whom they conceived the Authors of their other, and more reſented grievances, I conceive they minded it not: and that there is ſcarce any good ground why a man ſhould think them, in that reſpect, more Catholikes then Proteſtants. And if a Prieſt, or ſome Eccleſiaſtical perſon were found amongſt them, (as it were ſtrange if there ſhould be none, conſidering how many there were then in the kingdom, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deſtitute, and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet certainly, they were not many, nor in any other quality
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48920:217"/> conſiderable. Whereas 'tis certain, that <hi>Kets</hi> camp in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> (a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of far greater conſequence and difficulty) were all of them ſuch as were fallen with the State from the profeſſion of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion, and become Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. And this I would generally premiſe, deſiring the Reader to obſerve it, that where I affirm of Catholikes, that they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt their Princes, nor raiſe any tumults in the kingdom, for matter of Religion, I mean ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as were Catholikes indeed, and ſtood firm in their Holy Recuſancy, not complying in any ſortwith thoſe alterations, which <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. or Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> in their ſeveral times procured to be made, contrary to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of Chriſtian Religion. For ſuch as complied were not to be counted Catholikes any longer, but Heretikes, Schiſmaticks, Hypocrites, &amp;c. And for ſuch people, having corrupted their faith to God, I
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48920:217"/> would not be taken to apologize in any other point of duty. For 'tis very poſſible they might ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome notions of Catholike Religion in their minds, which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, and upon other occaſions, running into terms of diſloyalty, they might pretend as matter of complaint againſt their Prince, though themſelves were neither Catholike; nor <hi>That,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter <hi>purely Spiritual,</hi> the true original cauſe of their Diſorder; but onely thoſe Temporal Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances by which they ſmarted (as is aboveſaid) and which they ſaw well enough to procceed, either wholly, or in part, from the ſeveral alterations made.</p>

Neither did ſhe ſeem to value her Honor overmuch, in order to the bringing about of her chief deſign. For in open Parliament, after her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a change began, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, ſhe proteſted, that no trouble ſhould ariſe to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholikes,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>for any difference in Religion:</hi> Which did much abate the oppoſition, which otherwiſe might probably have been made by the Catholike party, and put the Clergy themſelves in ſome hopes of Fair quarter under her Government. She knew full well, that a Prince alone, how Sovereign ſoever, could not eſtabliſh a new Religions in his Kingdom; but that it muſt be the work of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament to give Authority and Countenance to a buſineſs of that
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:48920:221"/> nature. Therefore to win the Biſhops, and the reſt of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in Parliament to ſilence at leaſt, ſhe was content to uſe policy with them, and promiſe them fair; as Monſieur <hi>Mauviſſieir</hi> hath well obſerved,<note place="margin">Les me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir de Mons.

Add hereunto, That when the Act for Supremacy was revived (which was always the great Wheel of theſe Motions,) whereas by King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Law both Biſhops and Barons ſtood in danger thereof (as the examples of Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> had ſhewen) in this Parliament the Queen was content to exempt the Lords and Barons abſolutely from the Oath, (as they in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixths time had exempted themſelves,) and to leave the Rigor of it onely upon the Clergy and Commons.

                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:48920:221"/> changing it into <hi>Supream Governor;</hi> which, though it altered not the ſence, yet it abuſed ſome into a beleef, that the Queen pretended not unto ſo much in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, as the King her Father had done.

The chief and immediate cauſe of which hard procedings againſt them was the refuſing the Oath of Supremacy; for no other crime, no other fault could be charged upon them. This indeed they refuſed, as a thing which concerned their Conſcience very much. And although, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſome of the Prelates now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, had either for fear, or upon ſurprizal, in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, (when it was firſt enacted) given more conſent, or connivence to it, then became Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church to do; yet they had now better conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and reſolved to be conſtant,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:48920:233"/> not onely to the Doctrine of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Faith in that point, but alſo to the judgement of the whole Kingdom, which ſo lately in full Parliament had deſired the Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Law: and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Supremacy of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Authority to be, where Chriſt placed it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Sea Apoſtolike. Nor did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates refuſing to acknowledge the Queen Head of the Church, any thing more, then what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants themſelves, at leaſt no mean ones among them, would likewiſe do. For 'tis manifeſt, that ſetting aſide ſome few <hi>Engliſh</hi> at home, they do generally abroad diſlike the Princes Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, as much as any. Not to mention <hi>Gilby,</hi> who in his Book called <hi>Admonitio ad Anglos</hi> calls King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth reproachfully <hi>Monſtrum Libidino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum &amp; Aprum, qui Chriſti locum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A libidinous Monſter, a Wilde Bore broken into Chriſts Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and making himſelf Head of

But when he ſaith, <hi>never did our Church give the Title of Supream Head of the Church to the Prince, nor the Prince chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it,</hi> who can tell, what he meaneth? For admit, that what was done by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth were not rightly ſaid to be done by <hi>their Church;</hi> yet I hope they will own the Church in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixths time, who challenged the Supremacy notoriouſly enough; as appeareth in the firſt Parliament which he held, wherein it was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, <hi>That whoſoever, after the Fifth of March nex enſuing, ſhould deny, that the Kings Heirs and Succeſſors were not, or ought not to be, Supream Head in Earth of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>immediately under
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:48920:235"/> God, for the third aſſertion, ſhould be guilty of Treaſon.</hi> And that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after him declined the Title, and choſe rather to be called <hi>Supream Governeſs,</hi> mended the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not a whit. For it was not the Title onely, but the power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto, and exerciſed by and under that Title, at which men made ſcruple; and that power Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> claimed and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed all her Reign, as much as ever King <hi>Edward</hi> her Brother had done. So that the refuſing of this Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely or chief matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the deprivation of the Catholike Biſhops, ſeeing Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelves were no better agreed about it, they might in all reaſon, have expected, if not a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſentence, yet at leaſt a more favorable Execution thereof, from the Queen; whom they had ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo unanimouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and no leſs willingly then any other perſons of the Realm. Who always bear themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſly towards her in temporal
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:48920:236"/> matters; never made complaint, never writ Libels, Invectives, or Books againſt her, as the Reformers in other parts perpetually did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Princes, and as too many of her Subjects at home, that is to ſay, Miniſters of her own making, and others, in ſhort time ſet themſelves to do. No Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of ſedition were diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people; No <hi>Wyat,</hi> No <hi>Oldcaſtle</hi> appeared in the Field by their inſtigation, notwithſtanding all the Adverſity, Diſgrace, Wants, which they ſuffered. In a word, ſuch was their behavior conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards her, even to the very laſt of their lives, that noe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man will attribute it to any thing elſe, but to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and right Chriſtian reſolution of thoſe worthy men, to ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly for ſuch a good cauſe; and unto that Patience, Humility, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Aequanimity, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Temper of Spirit, which, (as it was exemplary in them) ſo, is it indeed Innate, (as I may ſay,)
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:48920:236"/> and moſt natural unto all Vertuous and Religious men, that are truely Catholike.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> And ſuch in truth (though envy frown, when we ſpeak it) is the general Inclination and Temper of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholikes, towards their Sovereign Prince, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without the Realm; as the experience of their quiet behavior, for ſo many years together of hard times, have cleerly ſhewen. When I ſpeak of Catholikes <hi>within the Realm,</hi> I mean, Recuſants in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, (as we are called) men and women of all Eſtates and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; who have had our ſhares, and taſted of the Cup of affliction, (as God was pleaſed to adminiſter it unto us,) at this preſent not much leſs then a Hundred of years. When I ſpeak of thoſe <hi>without the Realm,</hi> I mean the Seminaries of Prieſts, Religious Perſons and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that be Catholike beyond the Seas. Concerning which Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we are to know, that when the old Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> Biſhops
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48920:237"/> and Prieſts, were ſome languiſhing in Priſon, other in Exile, many dead, and all in disfavor. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary and ſuch other Politick Proteſtants as then ſate at the Stearn of Government in <hi>England,</hi> did confidently imagin, that in a ſhort time both Prieſt and Prieſthood would be worn out and extingiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Nation. And truely it was obſerved, that about the year 1576. there were not above Thirty of the old Prieſts remaining in the Realm. Hereupon Doctor <hi>Allen,</hi> a man even raiſed by God to do his Country good in a time of greateſt neceſſity, together with ſome others of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, begun the Seminary at <hi>Doway,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1569. meerly out of ſpiritual charity towards their poor Country, and a Chriſtian Providence to prevent the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Religious Profeſſors, Prieſts and others: who might ſerve in time to come, to uphold true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>England,</hi> and to preſerve a Continuation of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:48920:237"/> Church there, (as it had ever been from the Apoſtles times to that preſent) unto ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: And as by the great bleſſing of God we ſee, their pious Counſels have had an happy effect unto this day; notwithſtanding the many oppoſitions, adverſities and difficulties, which they have met with, as well from <hi>England,</hi> as from other places. They inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo the Inſtruction and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of yong Scholars, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Catholike Nobility, Gentry and others of our Nation in the ſtudies of Learning, Vertue, and all kinde of honeſt and chriſtian Education; which, as the caſe ſtood, they could not poſſibly have in their own Country, without Ship-wracking of their conſciences, and great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of their ſouls. This, I ſay, was the firſt and onely deſign of the Seminaries, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a Nurſery of young and tender plants, as ſhould be committed to them, to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Service of God, and the leading of a true Chriſtian, Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48920:238"/> life afterward; and not to be Seedplots or Forges of Treaſon, and ſeditious practiſes againſt their Country, as their Adverſaries ceaſe not to accuſe them. That's a calumny black and palpable, as ſhall appear more hereafter. At preſent I ſhall onely take notice of what that great Protonotary of <hi>England</hi> brings in charge againſt them, in his Book called <hi>Juſtitia Britannica,</hi> which are three things. Firſt, That they are a company of baſe fugitive perſons. Secondly, that they corrupt the Land with falſe Doctrine: and Thirdly, That they practiſe with forreign States to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Kingdom, raiſe rebellion, and withdraw Subjects from their obedience. As touching the Firſt I am very well aſſured that there be Gentlemen of our Nation at <hi>Doway,</hi> both in the Colledge and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, of as good Families, as well Bred, and as Eminent Scholars, as any I have known of all theſe ſorts in the Univerſities of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I am not altogether a
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48920:238"/> ſtranger. I will not make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, for that were but to make them more odious; neither am I willing to detract any thing from the honor of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which I am bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It muſt be confeſſed, there be many excellent wits, and men of great learning bred in them; yet this I may truly ſay, That thoſe beyond Sea are of <hi>no baſe quality:</hi> neither is their education in thoſe places ſuch, as ſhould render them liable to that Character in time to come. Yea rather they are ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly governed, and their times of ſtudy, devotion, exerciſe both Scholaſtical and Spiritual, recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea even of their moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary repaſt and reſt, are all ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly meaſured out to them, all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of idleneſs, exceſs, and ill company, ſo prudently and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevented, that it is indeed no wonder, they appear ſo civil, ſo devout, ſo religious, temperate, ſober and well governed, in all outward deportment, as, through
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:48920:239"/> the grace of God, they do. They are, as I ſaid, by their Superiors ſtrictly kept to their tasks; yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther won, then forced unto good. They are bridled with a hard bit, but it is carried with ſuch a gentle hand, as it doth not pinch, but guide them: So that, as their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, bleſſed be God, are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unhappy; ſo neither is their life unpleaſant, but ſweet, agreable to vertuous mindes, and full of the Nobleſt contents. And that they ſhould be counted <hi>Fugitives</hi> is moſt injurious. For do they live there as Outlaws in a forreign Province? have they fled for any crime? doth Juſtice enquire after them, or wait for them in their own Country? what Felonies, what Treaſons have driven them thence? but ſuch as a very few years before, were, not onely in the ſame place, where they are now ſo hardly cenſured, but in all places of Chriſtendom, and by all people of ſound judgement, counted the greateſt vertues? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they live not there out of
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:48920:239"/> any factiouſneſs of ſpirit, or ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards his Majeſtie or the State of <hi>England,</hi> but for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake onely, and to avoid the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Laws enacted here againſt Catholikes and the profeſſion of Catholike Religion. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that compels them to take this courſe. In <hi>England</hi> Catholikes have no Churches, wherein to ſerve God publickly, nor liberty to ſerve him privately any where elſe. The Sacraments are never, or but very ſeldom Adminiſtred to them, in compariſon of what they ſhould be. They can have no priviledge, or benefit of the Univerſities for education and ſtudy, without Oaths, going to Church, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doing many other things, contrary to a good conſcience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all this, did not <hi>Barty, Knolls,</hi> and <hi>Hales,</hi> did not <hi>Jewel, Horn, Cox, Pilkington, Poynet</hi> and many others in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, take the ſame courſe, for conſcience as they pretended? They would not willingly have been called <hi>Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
                  <pb n="476" facs="tcp:48920:240"/> when they were abroad. Why then ſhould thoſe Gentlemen at <hi>Doway,</hi> Saint <hi>Omars,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, Exil'd, as it were, at preſent from their native Country upon the ſame common pretence and reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> reaſon of conſcience, be called <hi>Fugitives,</hi> or ſtigmatized with any ſuch Characters of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny? Let thoſe Laws be repealed firſt, which threaten preſent death to them upon their return, and which were all procured againſt them, unduly, and by miſprizion, <hi>viz.</hi> of their ſuppoſed practiſings againſt the State, which (as they complain) were never proved, nor are true. Let it be permitted to them to enjoy Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to ſerve God, as all good Catholikes and Chriſtians ought to do, without moleſtation and danger to their perſons, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their eſtates, further then they ſhall give juſt offence to the State, and the world would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, where their trueſt affections lay: Neither <hi>Doway,</hi> nor St. <hi>Omars,</hi>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:48920:240"/> nor <hi>Rhemes,</hi> nor <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf would hold them, from returning with all thankfulneſs and ſpeed, to expreſs their humbleſt obedience to his Majeſtie, and fidelity to their native Country. And as for their Parents Kinsfolks and Friends, from whom they are now unhappily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated (and from many of them, perhaps, againſt their wills,) they ſhould plainly finde, that natural affection was not extinguiſhed in them, neither would kindneſs creep, where it might ſafely go.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The Second objection is, <hi>They corrupt the Land with falſe Doctrine.</hi> This objection ſuppoſeth, that <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and the preſent Religion <hi>by Law eſtabliſhed</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> is the true; which <hi>England</hi> it ſelf denied but a few years ſince: and the whole Chriſtian world doth at this day.

For we maintain the contrary. And deſire to know, what one Doctrine it is that we charge them with, as odious and offenſive to Chriſtian eares, but the Reader, if he pleaſe, may finde it expreſsly and undeniably verified upon them by our Authors, and perticularly in that exact Treatiſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> called <hi>Collatio doctrinae Proteſtantium, &amp;c.</hi> extant both in Latine and Engliſh. what crime do we lay to their charge, but we prove it by Authors and Teſtimonies of good credit, and moſt commonly from among themſelves? What do we bring out of Antiquity in behalf of Catholike Religion, or againſt them, which they themſelves confeſs not upon ſome other occaſion? The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Apology is a Magazine of Evidences in this kinde. And as
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48920:244"/> concerning the <hi>Index Expurgatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whereby they pretend, that we <hi>Corrupt Authors,</hi> it is onely a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious calumny to catch thoſe, who are willing to be deceived. For firſt the very maner of proceeding doth exempt it from all imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuſpicion of Fraud with indifferent men; it being <hi>ab origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> a thing intended and made for publike view, and to be openly expoſed and avowed to the world, as it was: which matters of Fraud Forgery and falſe play uſe not to be. Secondly, the Expurgators, appointed to the overſight of that buſineſs, meant not to <hi>corrupt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> but to <hi>correct former and leſs perfect Editions</hi> by better Copies and more exactly compared; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch <hi>Editions,</hi> as they found corruptly and partially publiſhed by Hereticks.

Beſide when we ſay, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes are not guilty of miſalledging Authors, or of any other abuſe of that nature, we would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to ſpeak, not onely of wilful and culpable miſalledging, (of which onely we accuſe our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries) but alſo of ſuch writers eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,

For otherwiſe, as we do not charge them here with any miſtakes of <hi>Amès, Bucanus, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> or any other of thoſe Niblers at <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as Maſter <hi>Normington</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> once called them in a Sermon at Saint <hi>Maries</hi>) much leſs with the impudencies of the Miniſter <hi>Craſhaw,</hi> nor with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of <hi>Chark, Fenner, Beard, Burton,</hi> or any other Triobolary Controvertiſts at home, either of former or preſent times, but, as you ſee, onely with faults of their Prime Leaders, Claſſicall men, Prelates and Dignitaries of their Church; ſo, if it ſhould happen, that any private man of our own,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48920:245"/> writing onely by private Authority and judgement, ſhould either through overſight, or indiligence be found chargeable with ſome kinde of miſtake, we would not have it ſtood upon, as if it were the common practiſe of all to write ſo negligently; or that the defence of Catholike Religion did any wit depend upon ſuch miſtakes: As we ſay the defence of Proteſtancy doth very much upon thoſe miſtakes, which we are ready to bring in charge againſt them, and without which there were not half the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for defence of it.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Concerning the third point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prieſts and Students in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seminaries beyond Sea are <hi>Practicers againſt the State,</hi> and <hi>do ſtir,</hi> or <hi>endeavor to ſtir the People to Rebellion,</hi> it is indeed an odious and heavy charge, which the Book called, <hi>The execution of Juſtice, &amp;c.</hi> layeth roundly upon them; and is ſeconded therein by a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the year 1580. which doth directly charge thoſe Prieſts and
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48920:246"/> others, as Acceſſories, and privy to the Counſels of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Pope, and ſome other Catholike Princes, which (as 'tis ſaid,) had combined together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time to invade <hi>England,</hi> to depoſe the Queen, and ſubdue the Nation to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> But for anſwer I ſay, that jealouſie is a kinde of <hi>Argus,</hi> (full of eyes; (and ſo ſhe is painted,) but they are all purblinde: which is the cauſe, that ſhe miſtakes ſo oft, ſtarts at her own ſhadow, and is always trembling, and doubting the worſt of every body. We cannot deny, but there were great States-men, that governed <hi>England</hi> in thoſe days under the Queen; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it happened, with all their Opticks they ſeemed not to have any particular foreſight of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which threatned them, till they were at their doors: yea having <hi>by error of Government</hi> provoked and drawn them upon themſelves, yet they took a courſe more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to kindle the flame, then to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:48920:246"/> quench the fire. But this is not a buſineſs to be diſcuſſed now. That which we are to do is to juſtifie the Prieſts and other <hi>Good men</hi> of the Seminaries, that they are not Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, are not Enemies of the State, do not practiſe, conſult, cooperate, where they live, to any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Firſt, if any ſuch Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been betwixt his Holineſs, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt <hi>England,</hi> as is pretended, but was never yet proved; (and 'tis well known, that what the Catholike King did afterward, as it was upon great provocations given, ſo was it alſo upon his own ſcore onely; and with no other aſſiſtance, but what was his own, and ordinary in ſuch caſes.) Yet, I ſay, ſuppoſe there had been ſuch Confederation or League betwixt them, is it probable, that ſo great and wiſe Princes, as they were, would acquaint a few poor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative men, Students at <hi>Rhemes</hi> and <hi>Doway,</hi> with their deſigns?
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:48920:247"/> Men ſo inconſiderable every way in relation to ſuch ſervice, ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and unable, in reſpect of their maner, condition and place of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, to contribute any thing to the work? Is it credible, they would manage ſuch high matters, and of ſo great importance, ſo weakly? Let no man ſay, That Prieſts might ſerve them by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a party here, and by their <hi>reconciling of men to the Pope.</hi> For it is not the Prieſts work to reconcile men <hi>to the Pope,</hi> but unto God, and to the Communion of the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church: whereof, although the Pope, as ſucceſſor to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> be Supream and chief Paſtor; yet Catholikes, by returning to the Church, and conſequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that Supremacy <hi>of Spiritual Authority</hi> in his Holineſs, are not obliged ſo much as to take notice of any Temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns that he hath; no, though they were, perhaps, for advancement of Religion: much leſs to conſent, concur, or cooperate with them
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:48920:247"/> contrary to the Law of nature, their Duty of Allegience, and the intereſt of their native Country. Secondly, among ſo many Prieſts, as by that time there were, both in England and beyond the Seas, and in ſo long a time, that this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Confederacy was in framing, when Spies and Intelligencers were many, and well paid by the State, was there ſo much as one Prieſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated or accuſed to have been ſo corrupted, or induced any way by thoſe Princes, or their Miniſters, to practiſe ought to the prejudice of their Country? was there ever any one apprehended or convicted of ſuch a trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In a word, when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armado was under Sail for <hi>England,</hi> was there ſo much as one Prieſt, or Seminary-man found or known to be in it? or at any time ſince diſcovered to have been uſed, or imployed in that ſervice? 'Tis
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:48920:248"/> confeſſed, the Proclamation ſpoken of before, being framed on purpoſe to put people into a fright, and to make honeſt men odious, doth traduce them ſufficiently, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuborned to prepare the way, and procure ſafe landing for the Navy. But <hi>Si accuſaſſe ſufficit, quis erit innocens?</hi> Such general charges prove nothing but paſſion, or ſome undue, byaſſed, and diſtempered judgement. They that know ſuch men well, know it to be a buſineſs far out of their way, to ſpie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to obſerve, how Ports are gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and what Havens lie upon the Goaſt. However it is evidence of fact, and the conviction, at leaſt queſtioning of ſome one perſon for ſuch crime, that would be given in the caſe: Which ſeeing there never was, Indifferent men cannot but think ſuch Accuſations to have been very injurious; and that the great fears and jealouſies ſhewen, had more of the <hi>Chimaera</hi> and fiction in them, then of real danger. It was otherwiſe with the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:48920:248"/> themſelves in <hi>Spain</hi> not long after, both Religious and others. For when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armado, in the year 1589. made an attempt upon <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and invaded ſome parts of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> took them to be ſo little either his Friends, or Enemies to their Prince and Country, as they are traduced, that he laid them all faſt by the Heeles, and kept them cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, (during the whole time, that the Action laſted,) as many of them, as were found at <hi>Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe objections are but few, and therefore I ſhall diſpatch them breifly. The firſt is
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:48920:257"/> brought againſt Doctor <hi>Allen,</hi> for teaching to murther Princes, in a certain Apology, which he wrote of the Seminaries, &amp; citing <hi>Num.</hi> 25. to that purpoſe. I anſwer, The miſtake is very great; it was not Doctor <hi>Allen,</hi> but Doctor <hi>Goodman</hi> (if we may call him ſo) that citeth that Text of <hi>Numbers</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.<note place="margin">Goodm.

And although,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it may ſeem a great diſorder, that Common people ſhould take ſo much Authority upon them, yet when the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:48920:257"/> inferior Magiſtrate neglecteth his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Common people muſt be lookt upon, as having no Magiſtrate at all to direct them: and in ſuch caſe God puts the Sword immediately into their hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe thoughts it never came to conceive, much leſs to publiſh ſuch Paradoxes of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All that he teacheth tends rather to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> to keep people in their due bounds, and to exhort them not to be tranſported by any unadviſed or evil paſſions againſt their governors under a pretence of zeal. He confeſſeth indeed, 'tis a thing commendable, when men are zealous for true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but he adviſeth, that they act <hi>modo &amp; Tempore, in due manner,</hi> that is, no otherwiſe then lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they may, and with regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all other acknowledged rules of a good conſcience; and <hi>in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that is, not untill they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereto by lawful Authority:
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:48920:258"/> as in the caſe of the Idolatrous <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi>

This is not to put the Sword into the peoples hand, and to permit them to execute their fiery zeal upon whom they pleaſe, under a pretence of puniſhing Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and rooting out Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; eſpecially ſuch, as no man judgeth to be ſo but themſelves. The Second objection is made by Doctor <hi>Sutcliff</hi> in his <hi>Turcopapiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> againſt Father <hi>Parſons, viz.</hi> that he ſuborned or hired <hi>Roderick Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez,</hi> a <hi>Portugheſs,</hi> and ſome others to kill the Queen: Which Treaſon, ſaith he, was diſcovered by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> I anſwer, it is like the Tale of <hi>Peter Panny,</hi> that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be hired by <hi>Mavaraeus</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Doway</hi> and Provincial of the Jeſuites, to kill Count <hi>Maurice;</hi>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:48920:258"/> which upon examination proved but a Fable, and ſo will this. For firſt, was there any perſon named in that Action but <hi>Lopez</hi> and his Countrimen, that is, ſome <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſſes</hi> and <hi>Spaniards?</hi> I have ſeen and read all the Examinations tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in that buſineſs, wherein all the circumſtances thereof are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, The Ayders, Movers, Actors, all nominated: There is not the leaſt mention of Father <hi>Parſons</hi> in the whole buſineſs, from firſt to laſt. Secondly, when Maſter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerton</hi> at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> ſo largely and eloquently urged all he could, did he ſo much as once name Father <hi>Parſons?</hi> Or was he a man likely to forget him, if he had found or thought him any way Acceſſory? Beſide all this, <hi>F. Parſons</hi> himſelf was known to be a man not of that weakneſs (whatſoever men will think of his honeſty) as to venture his reputation, life, intereſt and all ſo unadviſedly in a forreign bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and ſubject to ſo many leaks, as that was. This therefore may
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48920:259"/> paſs for a ſcandalous Fiction and Hear-ſay, but no more. A Third objection is made againſt <hi>Parry,</hi> and ſounded aloud in all mens eares, as a reproach and ſtain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible to Catholike Religion. The ſum of the charge is, that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was incited by the Popes Letters to kill the Queen. I anſwer, The Acts or proceſs it ſelf of his Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Tryal do ſhew, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conference with Maſter <hi>Wats</hi> a Seminary Prieſt about this buſineſs, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Wats</hi> diſliked both his motion and attempt, and told him, that <hi>it was a thing unlawful that he went about:</hi> As likewiſe did ſome other Prieſts alſo, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the buſineſs. Secondly, at <hi>Lyons</hi> coming to <hi>F. Creighton</hi> a Jeſuite, and after Confeſſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his intention to him, out of ſome Confidence, it ſeems, that the good man would bite at ſuch a bait, he found himſelf as much miſtaken here, as before. For the Father reſolves him, <hi>That it was utterly unlawful,</hi> and uſeth diverſe
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48920:259"/> reaſons to diſwade him from any further proceeding, as <hi>Parry</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth to the Queen, and <hi>Holinſhead</hi> in his Chronicle doth acknowledge: So that already both the Prieſt and Jeſuites are acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. There remains onely the Letter of Cardinal <hi>Como</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Touching which we are to know, this <hi>Parry</hi> had lived in <hi>Italy,</hi> as a Spy, a long time, and being upon his return, was deſirous to furniſh himſelf with a project, that might ſerve his turn in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> both ways, that is, both to abuſe Catholikes, (as he did, by pretence of the Popes Letters,) and to deceive the Queen. Therefore having found ſo little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Lyons,</hi> as we have ſaid, he travels to <hi>Paris,</hi> and endeavors to inſinuate himſelf with Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> (who was there at that time, with the Lord <hi>Paget</hi>) but with no better ſucceſs to his deſigns, then he had found before with <hi>F. Creigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Wats.</hi> Howbeit by ſome means he procured himſelf
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:48920:260"/> acceſs to the Popes Nuncio then reſident in the City, to whom he preſents a Letter written in Italian by himſelf, which he deſires might be recommended by the ſaid Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio to his Holineſs; which was done. In this Letter he confeſſeth firſt, what great wrongs he had done to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in former time; but was now returning into <hi>England,</hi> intending to make them ſome ſatisfaction by his ſervice there: And to that end deſired the Approbation and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Holineſs; not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying any thing in particular, what he intended; as may be ſeen by his Letter, which is upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. To this Letter of <hi>Parry,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Como</hi> anſwereth in the Popes name, in ſuch manner as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man knows. For the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Letter is common to be ſeen. Let any man read and examine it, if there be any particular ſervice intimated, or any Treaſonable or ſeditious directions given; but onely a general encouragement

And to
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:48920:261"/> gain him the better credit with them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Catholikes, it was ordered ſo, that he was once very formally convented in Parliament, where he ſo boldly defended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of <hi>England;</hi> that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, not knowing, that all was but out of deſign by the Queen and her Counſel, committed him to the Tower: Which did indeed very much encreaſe his reputation with the Prieſts and Fathers here. But his liberty was ſoon procured, and himſelf had ſuch continual acceſs to the Queen, ſuch favor with the Treaſurer and others, that once he had no ſmall hopes to have been made Maſter of Saint <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharines.</hi> Howbeit the Counſel perceiving him but to faulter, and fail in the main buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying Catholikes, and eſpecially in the buſineſs of the Lord <hi>Latimor,</hi> (whom the Treaſurer would fain have caught in <hi>Parries</hi> net) himſelf at laſt became ſuſpected, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled by degrees in ſuch Snares,

But they both fled away ſecretly, and left Father <hi>Walpoole</hi> in the Lurch to anſwer for them: yet afterwards ſending him Letters to excuſe their ſuddain departure; which he alſo produced for his diſcharge.

But let the Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider circumſtances well, and then weigh the Endictment. <hi>Squire</hi> is accuſed, that Father <hi>Walpoole</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and inſtructed him to poyſon the Queen, and preached to him at his departure to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Is this probable? For firſt they fled both of them away ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Sivil, Squire</hi> and <hi>Rolls</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without Father <hi>Walpooles</hi> knowledge, and as 'tis generally known to be true. Secondly, <hi>Squire</hi> was a man, that always profeſſed himſelf a Proteſtant, in <hi>Spain</hi> as well as in <hi>England;</hi> and ſo died. Who can dream that Father <hi>Walpoole</hi> knowing this, as well as himſelf, ſhould make ſuch a propoſition to him? Thirdly, both at his arraignment and death he conſtantly denied any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48920:263"/> to have been propounded to him by any perſon on earth. And though having bin upon the Rack no leſs then five times, the torture made him at laſt to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt himſelf, yet he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards conſtantly denied it, even to his death. And all men know, an argument from the Rack, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when 'tis afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed, is reckoned elſewhere but a mean evidence or proof.

But ſurely as to the means whereby they procure it, and the courſe and manner of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that ſeek and endeavor it, This treatiſe hath already ſhewen, what great odds and difference there is betwixt the proceedings of Catholikes, and that of Proteſtants.

However, thoſe Doctors <hi>Boutefeux</hi> ſhould doe well to remember, if they pleas'd, that even by the Law of Seniority Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes might expect ſome little favour. For we beſeech them to tell us, upon what Patrimony doe themſelves and families now live, but that which the right Heirs of the Church, diſ-inherited indeed, or diſſeized by the power of the State, have left them? What Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, Immunities, Honours have they, but what the old Church gave them? What Churches have

All things are in the hands of God; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath determined in the Counſel of his Divine wiſdom muſt ſtand, and take effect in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed due time: ſay we, or do we to the contrary, what we can. And therefore let our hot Brethren the Calviniſts, who can themſelves ſo little endure the ſeverity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, let them not further promote, nor hold up perſecution againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body elſe; leaſt in an howre when they think leſt of it, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which they wiſh to others, fall upon their own heads; and that they finde themſelves, not onely out of the Saddle (where they would be) but in the Mire, <hi>under the Horſe belly,</hi> and ſo obnoxious, as they may have need of favor themſelves. They deſire nothing more then <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in

What <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion was in the point I value no much, becauſe the world did not take him for a man very learned or very wiſe; although, by Gods permiſſion, he did much miſchief in it for his time: as a ſimple Conjurer, though he be neither Mathematician, nor Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher himſelf, yet, by the help of the Devil, may raiſe a ſtorm able to confound all the Sciences.

No man doubteth, but <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, Emperor, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother were in their times great and wiſe Princes; yet found they no better means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the troubles of State, then by commanding, <hi>

Why ſhould our Government be more ſevere in this point, and more Sanguinary then that of our Neighbors? It may ſeem to reflect ſomething upon the honor of our Nation, to mention the <hi>Turk</hi> in this caſe: Yet certainly it cannot be denied, but that Chriſtians live

Sixthly, <hi>Baldwinus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Lutheran,</hi> writes a Book purpoſedly upon this Subject, and confeſſeth in plain termes, That it was a real Truth, no fiction or dream, but a matter of fact, and a true Story. His onely excuſe of it is this. <hi>It happened,</hi> ſaith he <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Luther <hi>had abandoned the Maſs;</hi> and thinkes the Devils intent was onely to bring to <hi>Luthers</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <hi>his old errours,</hi> that he <hi>had been a Prieſt, and ſaid Maſs fifteen years together, and ſo to drive him to deſpair.</hi> But truly, if that were all the deſign, <hi>The Devil was but an Aſs.</hi> To attempt ſuch a tried ſouldier as he was, armed <hi>cap a pe</hi> with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence invincible, and the Doctrin of <hi>only Faith,</hi> with ſuch a blunt and
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:48920:315"/> feeble weapon as deſpair? <hi>Luther</hi> was a man out of his reach for that. He that teacheth, nothing can hurt a Chriſtian but <hi>onely unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Supr. Sec. <hi>2.</hi> med.</note> 
               <hi>That if a man ſhould commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery or murder a thouſand times a day, it could not divide him from Chriſt; That the greater ſinner a man is, the neerer he is to Gods grace;</hi> could ſuch a man, think we, be brought <hi>to deſpair,</hi> onely by being told that he had ſaid Maſs in his time? and this too, as himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth ſomewhere, with <hi>a very pious intention,</hi> and thinking that he had pleaſed God, and done very well in ſo doing? Neither is there any paſſage in the whole diſputation to inſinuate ſuch a purpoſe. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil only plies his arguments againſt Maſs, againſt Prieſthood, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. And therefore if it muſt needs be granted, that the diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happened after that <hi>Luther</hi> had abrogated the Maſs, it may be much better thought, that he began to ſtagger in his enterprize, and to repent, perhaps, of what he he had
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:48920:315"/> done; and that the Devil ſaw it neceſſary to re-inforce his former, and but private ſuggeſtions (which yet had miſled him) by a ſecond and more ſolemn encounter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis clear, he was ſo far from pretending to make <hi>Luther deſpair,</hi> that he apparently tempts him to <hi>preſumption,</hi> while he blames him and <hi>the Papiſts</hi> for not having more <hi>confidence,</hi> for making as if Chriſt were unmerciful, by their flying to the Mediation of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And this by the way is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument, that the buſineſs fell out before <hi>Luther</hi> had abandoned Maſs, and not after, as this Author pretendeth. For that it is now onely related, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Luther</hi> wrote his Book <hi>de Abrogandâ Miſſà,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sur. Chron.</note> (which was abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the year 1521. and perhaps after he had aboliſhed Maſs) yet it proves not but the Conference might be ſome yeares before. For 'tis well known, (and himſelf profeſſeth it often) that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> fell by degrees into Hereſie, and not into all at once; and that he
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:48920:316"/> maintained Paradoxes at the laſt, which at the firſt he did not ſo much as think of. So that, having out of the vanity and pride of his heart given the Devil advantage over him, by his conteſting in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Indulgences in the year 1517. he lay open to any further temptation afterward. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that in the procedure of the diſpute, the Devil ſayes thus to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Haec <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctio tua vanior eſt, quàm Baptizatio ſaxi. This thy Anointing</hi> (ſaith he, meaning that of his Prieſthood) <hi>is a vainer thing, then if thou ſhouldſt baptize a ſtone.</hi> Which plainly inſinuates, that <hi>Luther</hi> was look't upon by his Adverſary at that time as a Prieſt, and one that uſed to ſay Maſs; and therefore it was before he had renounced either the one or the other.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> in his anſwer to his own Motives, hath a conceit beyond all theſe. He denieth not, but that the Story is true, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation real, nor but that it was while <hi>Luther</hi> was a Prieſt, and ſaid
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:48920:316"/> Maſs; But ſuppoſing Maſs to be evil, he thinketh the Devils deſign was thereby <hi>indirectly</hi> to keep him cloſer to it, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſaying Maſs: as knowing that any man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>Luther,</hi> would be ſhye of imbracing that which the Devil ſhould ſo apparently tempt him unto. But doubtleſs it were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves in a wilderneſs of uncertain thoughts, if leaving the certain Rule of Faith, and the no leſs clear evidence of fact (which in all caſes of this nature are the beſt grounds to frame a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon) we ſhould give our ſelves liberty to conjecture and ſuppoſe whatſoever may come in our minds. It is far better, and more ſafe to ſtick to the Rule; ſuch arbitrary conjectures having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more of prejudice and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt (not to ſay paſſion) in them, then of ſound and unbyaſſed reaſon. Now doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tell us, that the Devil is <hi>the Father of lyes, a lyar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi> Is he not the Enemy of God,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:48920:317"/> and the great enemy and deceiver of Soules? Are we not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>reſiſt his Temptations?</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of his wiles?</hi> not to hearken to his ſuggeſtions? why doe we not ſo? why will we deceive our ſelves, by pretending, even in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to his ſuggeſtions, as it were to over-reach him; who is a Spirit, yea the quinteſſence of deceit, and infinitely more crafty (I ſay not, then we can be, but) then we can imagine? You will ſay, ſhall we not hearken to him, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us to good?

And therefore, though by the permiſſion of God he can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times depoſe his own natural and ugly ſhape of Evil, and <hi>Transform himſelf,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>into an Angel of Light,</hi> yet he can never perſwade us to good, but out of
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:48920:317"/> ſome evil deſign: and that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to ſtand well upon our Guard, whenſoever we perceive him, to ſuſpend our conſent, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, to take all good adviſe, and to beware, though the thing which he perſwades were never ſo apparently good and honeſt; leſt, I ſay, we be caught by his wiles, which are many, and ſo intricately woven many times, that they are not eaſily perceived at firſt. As in this very caſe and combat with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſurely he was not ſo dull, as to think that <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> perſwaded <hi>by him</hi> to any thing, or that he would take any thing <hi>directly</hi> upon his word, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or perſwaſion onely; who can imagine this in reaſon? But this, I ſuppoſe, we may, <hi>viz.</hi> That he might think, <hi>Luther</hi> upon this diſputation, and ſeeing the Devil ſo earneſt againſt Maſs, might be apt to have many apprehenſions in himſelf, and caſt in his minde This and That, and probably enough that very thing in particular which
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:48920:318"/> Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> pitched upon, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould think <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil does but prevaricate with me all this while, and ſeemingly tempts me from that, to which he would have me ſtick cloſe:</hi> which apprehenſion alone, conſidering how much wavering and unſetled in his minde he was already, the Devil knew wel enough would be able to carry him cleerly to the point whither he moſt of all deſired to bring him, which was to renounce his Orders, and to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Maſs. As the event moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſhewed to be true; yea and as <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf in the ſequel of the Diſcourſe doth ſeem more then to intimate, anſwering an objection which ſome body made in theſe words, <hi>An ignoras Diabolum eſſe Mendacem, &amp;c.

But the caſe is ſo unlike, and there are ſo many miſtakes in the report of it, that it might well have been ſpared, had it not been, that the Doctor would ſeem to ſay ſomething more then had been ſaid before him. For firſt it was not an Abbot, but a Monk, whom the Devil tempted to ſay Maſs. Secondly, That Monk was not yet Prieſt; and ſo it was againſt the Canons, yea it had been a grievous ſin in him to have ſaid Maſs: This was fit matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the Devil to tempt a man
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:48920:319"/> unto; but, it ſeemes, it was not ſo fit for the Doctors purpoſe to mention this circumſtance, and therefore he leaves it out, as he uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do ſometimes in other like caſes. Thirdly, neither did Satan enter any diſputation with the Monk either to prove, or diſprove Maſs. Fourthly, nor did the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tempted conſent. Fifthly and laſtly, neither did Maſs then firſt begin, which is a thing principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be regarded: It was not (in the ſubſtance of the thing) a Novelty, which the Devil temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto, but an office of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion generally acknowledged, profeſſed, obſerved in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom over.
